# Project-One-Collab: Brewvey

## Description

For the recent transplants to Seattle we decided that a great date idea would be to go and checkout some of Seattle's incredible breweys. With that we created Brewvery!

The website works by clicking the start button where it takes you to another page where 4 randomly selected breweries are generated based on the user's preferences. Each brewery card includes a link to the website, the address, and the phone number for it. If the user does not like their initial selection they can select the "Randomize Brewery" button and it will select another 4 random reweries.

On that same page we see a randomized icebreaker in the form of a joke with the corresponding answer. Like the breweries if you do not like the joke you were provided or if just want anothing one you can select "New ICE Breaker" and it generate another joke for you.

## Usage

On the home page click the start button. That will push a modal up where you can select the type of brewery that you would like to see. Once you make a selection and click "Accept and Continue". It will then take you to page 2 where there will be 4 randomly generated breweries. You can select the website to be taken directly to their site or you can randomize the breweries if you would like as well. You can also randomize the joke at the bottom by clicking "New ICE Breaker"
